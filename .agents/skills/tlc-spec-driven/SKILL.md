description: Project and feature planning with 4 adaptive phases - Specify, Design, Tasks, Execute. Auto-sizes depth by complexity. Creates atomic tasks with verification criteria, atomic git commits, requirement traceability, and persistent memory across sessions. Stack-agnostic. Use when (1) Starting new projects (initialize vision, goals, roadmap), (2) Working with existing codebases (map stack, architecture, conventions), (3) Planning features (requirements, design, task breakdown), (4) Implementing with verification and atomic commits, (5) Quick ad-hoc tasks (bug fixes, config changes), (6) Tracking decisions/blockers/deferred ideas across sessions, (7) Pausing/resuming work. Triggers on "initialize project", "map codebase", "specify feature", "discuss feature", "design", "tasks", "implement", "validate", "verify work", "UAT", "quick fix", "quick task", "pause work", "resume work". Do NOT use for architecture decomposition analysis (use architecture skills) or technical design docs (use create-technical-design-doc).

# Tech Lead's Club - Spec-Driven Development

Plan and implement projects with precision. Granular tasks. Clear dependencies. Right tools. Zero ceremony.

```
┌──────────┐   ┌──────────┐   ┌─────────┐   ┌─────────┐
│ SPECIFY  │ → │  DESIGN  │ → │  TASKS  │ → │ EXECUTE │
└──────────┘   └──────────┘   └─────────┘   └─────────┘
   required      optional*      optional*     required

* Agent auto-skips when scope doesn't need it
```

## Auto-Sizing: The Core Principle

**The complexity determines the depth, not a fixed pipeline.** Before starting any feature, assess its scope and apply only what's needed:

| Scope       | What                     | Specify                                                 | Design                                          | Tasks                         | Execute                                               |
| ----------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Small**   | ≤3 files, one sentence   | **Quick mode** — skip pipeline entirely                 | -                                               | -                             | -                                                     |
| **Medium**  | Clear feature, <10 tasks | Spec (brief)                                            | Skip — design inline                            | Skip — tasks implicit         | Implement + verify                                    |
| **Large**   | Multi-component feature  | Full spec + requirement IDs                             | Architecture + components                       | Full breakdown + dependencies | Implement + verify per task                           |
| **Complex** | Ambiguity, new domain    | Full spec + [discuss gray areas](references/discuss.md) | [Research](references/design.md) + architecture | Breakdown + parallel plan     | Implement + [interactive UAT](references/validate.md) |

**Rules:**

- **Specify and Execute are always required** — you always need to know WHAT and DO it
- **Design is skipped** when the change is straightforward (no architectural decisions, no new patterns)
- **Tasks is skipped** when there are ≤3 obvious steps (they become implicit in Execute)
- **Discuss is triggered within Specify** only when the agent detects ambiguous gray areas that need user input
- **Interactive UAT is triggered within Execute** only for user-facing features with complex behavior
- **Quick mode** is the express lane — for bug fixes, config changes, and small tweaks

**Safety valve:** Even when Tasks is skipped, Execute ALWAYS starts by listing atomic steps inline. If that listing reveals >5 steps or complex dependencies, STOP and create a formal `tasks.md` — the Tasks phase was wrongly skipped.

```

## Workflow

**New project:**

1. Initialize project → PROJECT.md + ROADMAP.md
2. For each feature → Specify → (Design) → (Tasks) → Execute (depth auto-sized)

**Existing codebase:**

1. Map codebase → 7 brownfield docs
2. Initialize project → PROJECT.md + ROADMAP.md
3. For each feature → same adaptive workflow

**Quick mode:** Describe → Implement → Verify → Commit (for ≤3 files, one-sentence scope)

## Context Loading Strategy

**Base load (~15k tokens):**

- PROJECT.md (if exists)
- ROADMAP.md (when planning/working on features)
- STATE.md (persistent memory)

**On-demand load:**

- Codebase docs (when working in existing project)
- CONCERNS.md (when planning features that touch flagged areas, estimating risk, or modifying fragile components)
- TESTING.md (when creating tasks or executing — drives test type assignment and gate checks)
- spec.md (when working on specific feature)
- context.md (when designing or implementing from user decisions)
- design.md (when implementing from design)
- tasks.md (when executing tasks)

**Never load simultaneously:**

- Multiple feature specs
- Multiple architecture docs
- Archived documents

**Target:** <40k tokens total context
**Reserve:** 160k+ tokens for work, reasoning, outputs

## Sub-Agent Delegation

Use sub-agents to keep the main context window lean and enable parallel execution. The orchestrating agent plans and coordinates; sub-agents do the heavy lifting.

**When to delegate to a sub-agent:**

| Activity | Delegate? | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Research (design phase, brownfield mapping) | Yes | Research output is large; only the summary matters |
| Implementing a task | Yes | File reads, edits, test output consume context |
| Parallel `[P]` tasks | Yes (one per task) | The only way to actually run tasks in parallel |
| Sequential tasks with no `[P]` | Yes | Keeps implementation artifacts out of main context |
| Planning, task creation, validation reports | No | These require full accumulated context |
| Quick mode tasks | No | Too small to justify the overhead |

**What sub-agents return:**

- Status: Complete | Blocked | Partial
- Files changed: [list]
- Gate check result: [pass/fail + test counts]
- SPEC_DEVIATION markers (if any)
- Issues encountered (if any)

## Knowledge Verification Chain

When researching, designing, or making any technical decision, follow this chain in strict order. Never skip steps.

```
Step 1: Codebase → check existing code, conventions, and patterns already in use
Step 2: Project docs → README, docs/, inline comments, .specs/codebase/
Step 3: Context7 MCP → resolve library ID, then query for current API/patterns
Step 4: Web search → official docs, reputable sources, community patterns
Step 5: Flag as uncertain → "I'm not certain about X — here's my reasoning, but verify"
```

**Rules:**

- Never skip to Step 5 if Steps 1-4 are available
- Step 5 is ALWAYS flagged as uncertain — never presented as fact
- **NEVER assume or fabricate.** If you cannot find an answer, say "I don't know"
